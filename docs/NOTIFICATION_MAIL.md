## Configure Mail Notification

You can also activate an email notification from the satellite. However, this is only triggered if a previously configured 
threshold of consecutive faulty transmissions has been reached. When the threshold is exceeded, the log files collected up 
to that point are attached to the email and sent to the destination address. No further notifications are sent. Only when a 
scan has been successfully transmitted is a new notification possible when the configured threshold is reached
